# Bling
> A hybrid notice sharing app proposed for Don Bosco Institute of Technology - By ACM Development Team. 

## Motivation
Communication between college admins/faculties and students generally happen through WhatsApp. 
However, in most cases these are not direct communications since all notices are first passed on to the 
respective class representatives and the class representatives forward it to the class groups. 
This process is sometimes quite time consuming and also there is probability of important notices getting lost 
among other informal talks in the group.


We proposed this idea of having a messaging application through which notices can be directly sent to a class of students.
For eg: If a professor wants to send a notice to Second Year students of the Computer department, all the professor has to
do is type the message, select the departments-years to which the message has to be sent and that's it. 
All the students who have downloaded the app (which is proposed to be kept compulsory) will receive an instant notification of the message in the application much like Whatsapp.

## Features
1. Cross-platfom (Android & iOS).
2. Send messages to multiple classes at once.
3. Notification on receiving messages.
4. Attach file to messages.
5. All messages stored locally for offline access.
6. Star messages.
7. Search messages.
